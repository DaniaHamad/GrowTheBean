# GrowTheBean
A simple talking to the plant game made during Kenny Jam 2022 using the Godot engine.

This game was made in 3 hours, due to technical issues, I couldn't submit it on time, so I'll upload it here.

The main objective is to reach the sky to get the gold by talking to the plant and get it grow.

## Download
This game currently can be played on windows and android. To download go to the branch 'exported'

## Hints
- Talk positively: the plant will grow.

- Talk negativiely: the plant will shrink.

- Any other neutral talk will take no effect.
