# GrowTheBean
A simple talking to the plant game made during Kenny Jam 2022 using the Godot engine.

This game was made in 3 hours.

Due to technical issues, I couldn't submit it to the jam on time.

The main objective is to reach the gold by talking to the plant and get it grow to reach the sky.

## Hints
- Talk positively: the plant will grow. The positive words that has been already used will not effect the plant.

- Talk negativiely: the plant will shrink.

- Any other neutral talk will take no effect.
